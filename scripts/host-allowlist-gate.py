"""Refuse a tracked file that references a host or an address this repository does not publish.

This bundle was derived from a working tree that is not published, and the
derivation deleted every reference to a host, a path and an internal identifier
belonging to that tree. A deletion holds for exactly as long as nobody puts one
back, and the way one comes back is not a decision: it is a paragraph copied
across, a comment restored from an older revision, a generator whose header still
carries the URL it was written under.

So the check here is a POSITIVE one. Every hostname any tracked file mentions must
appear in the allowlist below, or be a name RFC 2606 reserves so that a document
can carry a host that resolves to nobody; every local filesystem path and mail
address is refused outright. A negative check would have to spell the strings it forbids,
which puts them in the repository that must not carry them; this one never names
anything it is protecting against, and it catches a host nobody thought to forbid.

    scripts/host-allowlist-gate.py --list      # what was seen, and how often

Exit codes:
    0  every referenced host is on the allowlist and no local path or address
       appears
    1  at least one reference is not allowed; each is printed with its file, its
       line number and the line
    2  could not check: this is not a git checkout, or `git ls-files` returned
       nothing, which is a broken read and never a clean one
