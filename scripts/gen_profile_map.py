"""Measure what each rail enforces, per obligation, and write the profile maps.

The disposition in a profile map is MEASURED, never typed. Every rail is run
over every vector in this bundle's corpus projection, the per-vector verdicts
are recorded, and each obligation's disposition follows from the vectors that
cite it:

    enforced       the rail matched the oracle on every vector citing the
                   obligation, AND profiles/rule-index.json names a rule in that
                   rail that exists.
    approximated   the rail matched the oracle on every vector citing the
                   obligation, and no rule has been named for it. The rail
                   behaves correctly on everything the corpus forces here, and
                   nobody has yet pointed at the line that does it.
    unreachable    the rail's answer differs from the oracle on at least one
                   vector citing the obligation, or no vector citing it appears
                   in this bundle's corpus projection at all. Either way the
                   rail is not shown to enforce it here, and the map carries an
                   obstruction from the closed vocabulary saying which.

`approximated` is deliberately the default for a rail that agrees with the
oracle, because agreement on the vectors that happen to exist is weaker than a
named rule. Promoting a row to `enforced` costs one line in the rule index and
the gate then checks the rule is really there.

Exit codes:
    0  measured and written
    2  could not measure: a rail binary is missing, the corpus is unreadable, or
       the vendored obligation registry is absent. Nothing is written, because a
       map written from a partial measurement reads exactly like a complete one.
