#
#   bash <this-directory>/install.sh
#
# `core.hooksPath` is local config. No clone inherits it, so every fresh
# clone must run this once; a clone that does not has no hooks at all, which
# is why the same rules are also enforced in CI.
#
# Three properties this script has on purpose, each one a bug that already
# happened here:
#
# 1. It WRITES NO FILES. An earlier installer copied hooks into the resolved
#    hooks directory and destroyed a tracked `pre-push` that was running a
#    visibility guard, ruff and whole-tree strict mypy; it was recovered from
#    the index. This script only sets one config key, so there is nothing it
#    can overwrite.
# 2. It DERIVES the directory from its own location, with no hardcoded
#    one. Repositories keep their tracked hooks in different places
#    (`.githooks`, `tools/git-hooks`), and a hardcoded path is how a shared
#    installer starts lying about one of them.
# 3. It sets a RELATIVE path. An absolute `core.hooksPath` is shared by every
#    linked worktree of a repository, so one worktree ends up running another
#    checkout's hooks -- observed and fixed on this machine. A relative path
#    resolves per working tree and means the same thing in every clone.
#
# It also refuses to make things quietly worse: before switching, it compares
# the hooks git consults today against the ones it would consult afterwards,
# and aborts if any currently-live hook would stop running.
