# Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome: a policy rail that admits what it should
refuse, a vector the rails disagree on, a profile you need registered, or a
defect in the harness.

## Before you open a pull request

Run `bash .githooks/install.sh` once per clone. It points git at the tracked
hooks, which check commit messages and run the pre-push checks; CI runs the same
rules, so a clone that skips it finds out on the pull request instead.

The rails are measured, not asserted. A change to a policy under `rego/`,
`kyverno/` or `policy-controller/` needs the conformance harness to agree with
it; [Running the conformance harness](README.md#running-the-conformance-harness)
says how, and [Continuous integration](README.md#continuous-integration) lists
what CI refuses.

## License

Contributions are accepted under the repository's license,
[Apache-2.0](LICENSE), per section 5 of that license. There is no contributor
license agreement to sign; the one thing asked beyond the license is the
sign-off below.

## Signing off your commits

Every commit in a pull request carries a sign-off: a line at the end of the
commit message, in the name and email of the commit's author.

    Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.org>

The line certifies the [Developer Certificate of Origin](DCO): that you wrote the
change or otherwise have the right to submit it under this repository's license,
and that the record of your contribution is public. The text in [`DCO`](DCO) is
the Linux Foundation's Developer Certificate of Origin, version 1.1, unmodified.
It is the sign-off that in-toto and the Linux Foundation's projects ask for,
written the same way, so a commit you have signed off for one of them needs
nothing extra here.

`git commit --signoff` (or `-s`) adds the line. To add it to commits already on
your branch, run `git rebase --signoff main` and force-push the branch.

The `dco/sign-off` check verifies the line on every pull request and names each
commit that lacks one. It does not ask for a sign-off on a merge commit, on a
commit by a bot account, or on a maintainer's own commits, which the maintainers
license by publishing them.

A sign-off is a statement a person makes. If a coding assistant or another tool
wrote part of a change, you review the change, you are the commit's author, and
the sign-off is yours; a tool does not add one on your behalf.
