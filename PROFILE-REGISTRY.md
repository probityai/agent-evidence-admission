# Profile registry: what each rail enforces

93 obligations, 4 rails, and one row per pair. Every disposition below is measured by `scripts/gen_profile_map.py` from a live run of every rail over this bundle's corpus projection, and `scripts/profile-map-gate.py` refuses a map that claims more than the measurement supports.

Corpus digest `8b035678def9`, predicate type `https://in-toto.io/attestation/adversarial-execution-evidence/v0.7`. Re-derive the registry with `scripts/gen_condition_registry.py --corpus <vectors checkout>` and this document with `scripts/gen_profile_registry.py`.

## What the three dispositions mean

**enforced** the rail matched the oracle on every vector citing the obligation, and the map names a rule in that rail's own artifact that the gate opens the artifact and finds. A rail that answers differently from the oracle on any vector citing an obligation may not carry this value, and the gate makes that a hard error.

**approx** the rail matched the oracle on every vector citing the obligation and no rule has been named for it. This is the default for a rail that behaves correctly, because agreement on the vectors that happen to exist is a weaker claim than a named rule. Promoting a row costs one line in `profiles/rule-index.json`.

**unreachable** the rail is not shown to enforce the obligation here, and the row names an obstruction from a closed vocabulary saying which of the two reasons applies: the rail answers differently from the oracle on a vector citing the obligation, or no vector citing it appears in this projection at all. The second is a gap in what has been measured and says nothing about the rail, which is why it has its own value and is never folded into the first.

A row reading `unreachable (no-vector-in-projection)` is a hole in the measurement, not a finding about the rail. Closing one means adding a vector that forces the obligation, which is work in the conformance corpus rather than work here.
